# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Navier-Stokes Equations in MATLAB
This MATLAB implementation trains a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow. The model is validated against the well-known Lid-Driven Cavity Flow problem. Feel free to make any suggestions on how to improve this PINN.
